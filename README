A reduced example on how to continiously increase the used data in ssh.

Add a known_hosts file to the folder, then run test.sh.

To run the tests I do this:
rcctl -f start sshd
sh test.sh
sh plot.sh # check if memory is growing


plot.sh -	plot a line for each pid in ssh-mem.log using gnuplot
test.sh -	run ssh using control sockets, log memory usage
